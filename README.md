# VirtualLiveStage

The **VirtualLiveStage** repository is dedicated to creating live stages in virtual environments using Unreal Engine and Unity. This project aims to enable musicians, virtual singers, and performers to host live shows in virtual worlds and stream them online in realtime.

## Project Overview

### Engines Used
- **Unreal Engine (5.4.3)**
- **Unity**

### Current Progress
The initial phase of this project has been completed using Unreal Engine 5.4.3. A demo light show synchronized to a song, showcasing the potential of virtual stage design.

### Lighting Implementation with DMX and MagicQ
For stage lighting, this project uses the DMX tool MagicQ by Chamsys. MagicQ offers several advantages for implementing a stage lighting system within Unreal and Unity environments:

- **Precision**: MagicQ provides precise control over lighting, making it ideal for creating intricate light shows.
- **Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with Unreal Engine through the DMX plugin, allowing for real-time interaction between MagicQ and Unreal Engine’s light objects.
- **Flexibility**: MagicQ supports both timeline-based light shows and real-time interaction, offering a versatile approach to stage lighting.

In the Unreal Engine demo, I primarily used MagicQ to design the light show timeline, but real-time interaction between MagicQ and Unreal Engine’s light objects is also possible. The demo video was captured using Unreal’s CineCamera to highlight the stage design and lighting effects.

### Future Work
I plan to extend this project to Unity, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each engine in the context of virtual stage design. The goal is to identify the best practices for creating immersive virtual live performances in both environments.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to explore and develop this exciting project!
